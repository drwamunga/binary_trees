# binary_trees
# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
Binary Trees.
# Description
This project covers my learning track on DSA, precisely binary trees.
The concepts covered include:

What is a binary tree
What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
Data Structures
The following data structures and types of binary trees are used for this project.

Basic Binary Tree
/**
 * struct binary_tree_s - Binary tree node
 *
 * @n: Integer stored in the node
 * @parent: Pointer to the parent node
 * @left: Pointer to the left child node
 * @right: Pointer to the right child node
 */
struct binary_tree_s
{
    int n;
    struct binary_tree_s *parent;
    struct binary_tree_s *left;
    struct binary_tree_s *right;
};

typedef struct binary_tree_s binary_tree_t;
Binary Search Tree
typedef struct binary_tree_s bst_t;
AVL Tree
typedef struct binary_tree_s avl_t;
Max Binary Heap
typedef struct binary_tree_s heap_t;
Print function
A custom print function is used in this project for visualization purposes.

void binary_tree_print(const binary_tree_t *);
The function is defined in this file
